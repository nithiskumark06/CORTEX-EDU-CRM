📌 Overview

Cortex Edu CRM is an end-to-end, MySQL-only analytics project that models how a real-world can EdTech company tracks student behavior, course performance, revenue, retention, and churn using MYSQL.

The project is intentionally built with only MYSQL to demonstrate how far modern MySQL can be pushed for data science and analytics use cases.

🎯 Business Problems Solved

This project answers real questions asked by EdTech product, growth, and leadership teams, such as:

1. Which students are most engaged and which are at risk of churn?

2. How do different student cohorts behave over time?

3. Which courses generate revenue but fail to retain learners?

4. How do instructors rank by revenue, ratings, and engagement?

-All insights are derived using pure SQL on transactional CRM-style data.


🧠 Core Analytical Views:

1️⃣ student_360
Used for engagement analysis, churn detection

2️⃣ cohort_analysis
Used for retention strategy and course performance evaluation.

3️⃣ course_performance
Used to identify high-risk courses, star performers, and content issues.
